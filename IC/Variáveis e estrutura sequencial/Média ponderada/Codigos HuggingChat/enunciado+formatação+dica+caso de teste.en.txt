 Sure! Here's a Python program that does what you described:
```
notes = input("Enter four notes: ")
weights = (1, 2, 3, 4)
total = sum(note * weight for note, weight in zip(notes, weights))
average = total / sum(weights)
print(round(average, 1))
```
Here's how it works:

1. The `input` function is used to get the four notes from the user, separated by spaces.
2. The `zip` function is used to pair each note with its corresponding weight.
3. The `sum` function is used to calculate the total score by multiplying each note by its weight and then adding all those products together.
4. The `sum` function is used again to calculate the sum of all the weights.
5. The `round` function is used to round the weighted average to one decimal place.
6. The `print` function is used to display the rounded weighted average.
