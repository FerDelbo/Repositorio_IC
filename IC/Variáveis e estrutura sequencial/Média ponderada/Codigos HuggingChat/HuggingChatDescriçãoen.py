1. Read the four notes from the user using the `input()` function.
2. Convert the input values from strings to floats using the `float()` function.
3. Calculate the weighted sum of the notes by multiplying each note by its respective weight (1, 2, 3, and 4) and adding the results.
4. Calculate the weighted average by dividing the weighted sum by the sum of the weights.
5. Print the weighted average as the output.

Here's the Python code that implements this plan:

```python
# Read the four notes from the user
note1 = float(input("Enter the first note: "))
note2 = float(input("Enter the second note: "))
note3 = float(input("Enter the third note: "))
note4 = float(input("Enter the fourth note: "))

# Calculate the weighted sum
weighted_sum = note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4

# Calculate the weighted average
weighted_average = weighted_sum / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

# Print the result
print("The weighted average is:", weighted_average)
```

Please execute the code and provide the output.

**Important:** The user will provide the four notes by following the prompts in the code. After entering each note, press Enter. Once all four notes are entered, the code will calculate and print the weighted average.
