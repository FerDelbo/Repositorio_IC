```python
# Read four notes from a student
note1 = float(input("Enter the first note: "))
note2 = float(input("Enter the second note: "))
note3 = float(input("Enter the third note: "))
note4 = float(input("Enter the fourth note: "))

# Calculate the weighted average
weighted_average = (note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4) / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

# Print the weighted average rounded to one decimal place
print("The weighted average is: ", round(weighted_average, 1))
```

This code will prompt the user to enter the four notes one by one. It will then calculate the weighted average of the notes using the given weights. Finally, it will print the weighted average rounded to one decimal place.

Please execute this code and provide the output for verification.
