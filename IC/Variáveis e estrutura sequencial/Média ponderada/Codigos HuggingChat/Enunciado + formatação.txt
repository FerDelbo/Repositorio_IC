 Sure! Here's a Python program that does what you described:
```
# Get the four notes from the user
note1 = float(input("Enter the first note: "))
note2 = float(input("Enter the second note: "))
note3 = float(input("Enter the third note: "))
note4 = float(input("Enter the fourth note: "))

# Calculate the weighted average
weighted_average = (note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4) / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

# Round to one decimal place
weighted_average = round(weighted_average, 1)

# Print the result
print("Your weighted average is", weighted_average)
```
Here's how the program works:

1. The program starts by asking the user to enter four notes, and it stores them in the variables `note1`, `note2`, `note3`, and `note4`.
2. It calculates the weighted average of the four notes using the formula: `(note1 \* 1 + note2 \* 2 + note3 \* 3 + note4 \* 4) / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)`. This formula multiplies each note by its corresponding weight (1, 2, 3, or 4), adds up all the products, and then divides the sum by the total weight (which is 1+2+3+4=10).
3. The program rounds the weighted average to one decimal place using the `round()` function.
4. Finally, the program prints the rounded weighted average to the console.
