```python
# Read four notes from the student
note1 = float(input("Enter the first note: "))
note2 = float(input("Enter the second note: "))
note3 = float(input("Enter the third note: "))
note4 = float(input("Enter the fourth note: "))

# Calculate the weighted average
weighted_average = (note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4) / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

# Print the weighted average rounded to one decimal place
print(round(weighted_average, 1))
```

You can execute this code in a Python environment and provide the four notes as inputs. The program will calculate the weighted average based on the given weights and print the result rounded to one decimal place.

For example, if you input:
0.0
0.0
9.0
10.0

The output will be:
6.7

This Python code follows the given requirements and calculates the weighted average accurately. The user can run this code and provide the four notes as inputs to get the desired output.
