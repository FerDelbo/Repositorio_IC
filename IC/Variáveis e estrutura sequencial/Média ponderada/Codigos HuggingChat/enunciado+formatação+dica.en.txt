 Sure! Here's a possible implementation of the program in Python:
```
# Get the four notes from the user
note1 = float(input("Enter the first note: "))
note2 = float(input("Enter the second note: "))
note3 = float(input("Enter the third note: "))
note4 = float(input("Enter the fourth note: "))

# Calculate the weighted average
weighted_average = (note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4) / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

# Round the result to one decimal place
rounded_average = round(weighted_average, 1)

# Print the result
print("Your weighted average is", rounded_average)
```
This program first prompts the user to enter four notes, and then calculates the weighted average using the given weights (1, 2, 3, and 4). The `round()` function is used to round the result to one decimal place. Finally, the program prints the rounded weighted average to the console.
