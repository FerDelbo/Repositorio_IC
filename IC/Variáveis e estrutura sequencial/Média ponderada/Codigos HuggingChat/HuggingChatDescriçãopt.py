```python
# Read the four grades from the user
grade1 = float(input("Enter the first grade: "))
grade2 = float(input("Enter the second grade: "))
grade3 = float(input("Enter the third grade: "))
grade4 = float(input("Enter the fourth grade: "))

# Calculate the weighted average
weighted_average = (grade1 * 1 + grade2 * 2 + grade3 * 3 + grade4 * 4) / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

# Print the weighted average
print("The weighted average is:", weighted_average)
```

After executing this code, the user will be prompted to enter the four grades. The script will then calculate and display the weighted average based on the given weights. This will complete the task.

[Please execute the code and provide the output.]
