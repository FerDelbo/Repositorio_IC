 Sure! Here's an example program in Python that should do what you described:
```
# Get the four notes from the user
note1 = float(input("Enter the first note: "))
note2 = float(input("Enter the second note: "))
note3 = float(input("Enter the third note: "))
note4 = float(input("Enter the fourth note: "))

# Calculate the weighted average
weighted_average = (note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4) / (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

# Print the result
print("Your weighted average is", weighted_average)
```
This program prompts the user to enter four notes, and then uses the `float()` function to convert each input into a floating-point number. It then calculates the weighted average by multiplying each note by its corresponding weight (1, 2, 3, or 4), summing up the products, and dividing the result by the sum of the weights. Finally, it prints the weighted average to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
