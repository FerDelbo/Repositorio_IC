Here's the Python code to calculate the weighted average of four notes:

```python
# Input the four notes
note1 = float(input("Enter the first note: "))
note2 = float(input("Enter the second note: "))
note3 = float(input("Enter the third note: "))
note4 = float(input("Enter the fourth note: "))

# Calculate the weighted average
weighted_average = (note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4) / 10

# Round the weighted average to one decimal place
rounded_average = round(weighted_average, 1)

# Print the rounded weighted average
print("The weighted average is:", rounded_average)
```
