Description:
Write a program that reads four notes from a student. As output, print the weighted average, knowing that the weights of the evaluations are respectively: 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Input and output format:
The program must receive 4 floating point numbers, which must be applied to each of the notes, with the first note weighing 1, the second 2, the third 3 and the fourth 4. As output, the program must make the weighted average of these 4 notes with the imposed weights. This result must be rounded to one decimal place.

Tips:
Inside the print command, use the round(x, n) command to round the number x to up to n decimal places.
