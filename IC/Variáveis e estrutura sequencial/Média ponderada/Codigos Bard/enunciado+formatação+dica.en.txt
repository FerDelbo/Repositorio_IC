Sure, here is the Python code that reads four notes from a student and prints the weighted average:

```python
note1 = float(input("Enter the first note: "))
note2 = float(input("Enter the second note: "))
note3 = float(input("Enter the third note: "))
note4 = float(input("Enter the fourth note: "))

weighted_average = (note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4) / 10

print("The weighted average is:", round(weighted_average, 1))
```

This code first prompts the user to enter four floating-point numbers, which are then stored in the variables `note1`, `note2`, `note3`, and `note4`. Next, the code calculates the weighted average using the formula `(note1 * 1 + note2 * 2 + note3 * 3 + note4 * 4) / 10`. Finally, the code prints the weighted average to the console, rounded to one decimal place.
