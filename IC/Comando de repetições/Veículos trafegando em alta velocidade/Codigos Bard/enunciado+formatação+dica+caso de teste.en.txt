Sure, here is the Python program that determines which and how many drivers violated the speed limit by more than 20% and less than 50% above the maximum speed allowed for the road:

```python
def findSpeedingDrivers(speeds):
    speedLimit = speeds[0]
    infractions = 0
    violatingDrivers = []

    for i in range(1, len(speeds)):
        currentSpeed = speeds[i]
        exceeds20Percent = (currentSpeed / speedLimit) > 1.2
        exceeds50Percent = (currentSpeed / speedLimit) > 1.5

        if exceeds20Percent and not exceeds50Percent:
            infractions += 1
            violatingDrivers.append(i)

    print("Positions of drivers who violated the speed limit:")
    for driver in violatingDrivers:
        print(driver)

    print("Total number of drivers who violated the speed limit:", infractions)

# Example usage
speeds = [60.0, 73.9, 22.9, 72.1, 72.0, 100.6]
findSpeedingDrivers(speeds)
```
