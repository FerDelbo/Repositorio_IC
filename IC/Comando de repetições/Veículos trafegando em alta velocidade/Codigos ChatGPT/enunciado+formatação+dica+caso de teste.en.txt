Write a program in python that determines which and how many drivers violated the speed limit by more than 20% and less than 50% above the maximum speed allowed for the road.  
The input data is a vector recording the speeds measured by the mobile radar. The first value of the vector indicates the maximum speed limit of the road. The other values ​​are the speed records of the cars that traveled on the road. As output, the position in the vector of each driver who violated the speed is reported (one per line) and, in the end, the number of drivers who violated the limit.  
Use an accumulator variable to store the number of infractions.  
Consider that the values ​​entered as input are always valid, that is, they are real positives.  
This is case test for example:  
Input: \[60.0, 73.9, 22.9, 72.1, 72.0, 100.6\]  
Output  
1  
3  
2

Here is a Python program that meets your requirements:

def check_speed_violations(speed_data):
    max_speed_limit = speed_data[0]
    num_violations = 0
    violation_positions = []

    for i in range(1, len(speed_data)):
        speed = speed_data[i]
        allowed_speed_range = (1.2 * max_speed_limit, 1.5 * max_speed_limit)

        if speed > allowed_speed_range[0] and speed <= allowed_speed_range[1]:
            num_violations += 1
            violation_positions.append(i)

    for position in violation_positions:
        print(position)

    print(num_violations)

# Test the program with the provided example
speed_data = [60.0, 73.9, 22.9, 72.1, 72.0, 100.6]
check_speed_violations(speed_data)


This program defines a function `check_speed_violations` that takes the speed data as input, iterates through the speeds, checks for violations, and prints the positions of the violators and the total number of violations. The test with the provided example is included at the end.
