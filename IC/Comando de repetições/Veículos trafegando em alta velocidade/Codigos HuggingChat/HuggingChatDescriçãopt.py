1. Define a function called `speed_limit_violators` that takes in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the driver's name and their speed.
2. Iterate over the list of dictionaries and calculate the percentage by which each driver exceeded the speed limit. Assume the speed limit is 60 km/h for this task.
3. Check if the calculated percentage is between 20% and 50% (exclusive). If true, append the driver's name to a list called `violators`.
4. Return the `violators` list.

Here's the code for the user to execute:

```python
def speed_limit_violators(drivers):
    speed_limit = 60
    violators = []

    for driver in drivers:
        driver_name = driver['name']
        driver_speed = driver['speed']
        percentage_above_limit = ((driver_speed - speed_limit) / speed_limit) * 100

        if 20 < percentage_above_limit < 50:
            violators.append(driver_name)

    return violators

# Test the function with a sample list of drivers
drivers = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'speed': 70},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'speed': 80},
    {'name': 'Carol', 'speed': 90},
    {'name': 'David', 'speed': 100},
]

violators = speed_limit_violators(drivers)
print(f"The following drivers exceeded the speed limit by more than 20% and less than 50%: {violators}")
```

The user should execute this code, and the program will output the names of the drivers who exceeded the speed limit by more than 20% and less than 50%.

Once the user executes the code and provides the output, I will analyze the result and confirm if the task is solved. If there are any errors, I will fix them and suggest the corrected code. If the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, I will analyze the problem, collect additional information, and try a different approach.
