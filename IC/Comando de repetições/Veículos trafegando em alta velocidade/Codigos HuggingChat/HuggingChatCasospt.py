```python
def speed_infractions(speeds):
    max_speed = speeds[0]
    infractions = []
    for i in range(1, len(speeds)):
        speed = speeds[i]
        if speed > max_speed * 1.2 and speed < max_speed * 1.5:
            infractions.append(i)
    return infractions, len(infractions)

speeds = [60.0, 73.9, 22.9, 72.1, 72.0, 100.6]
infractions, count = speed_infractions(speeds)
for i in infractions:
    print(i)
print(count)
```

You can replace the `speeds` variable with the input data and execute the code. The code will output the index of each driver who violated the speed limit (one per line) and the total number of violations at the end.

Here's how the code works:
1. It defines a function called `speed_infractions` that takes a list of speeds as input.
2. It sets the maximum speed limit to the first value in the list.
3. It initializes an empty list called `infractions` to store the indexes of the drivers who violated the speed limit.
4. It loops through the rest of the list, starting from the second element.
5. It checks if the speed of the current driver is more than 20% and less than 50% above the maximum speed limit.
6. If the condition is true, it appends the index of the current driver to the `infractions` list.
7. After the loop, it returns the `infractions` list and the length of the list as a tuple.
8. The code then calls the `speed_infractions` function with a list of speeds as input.
9. It loops through the `infractions` list and prints the index of each driver who violated the speed limit.
10. Finally, it prints the total number of violations.

Here are the outputs for the given inputs:

Input: `[60.0, 73.9, 22.9, 72.1, 72.0, 100.6]`
