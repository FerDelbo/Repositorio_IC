Formato para entrada e saída de dados
The input format is "ddmmyyyy", where "dd" is the two-digit day of the month, "mm" is the two-digit month number of the year, and "yyyy" is the full year.
The output format is "day of month spelled out of year".

Dicas:
Always assume that input values ​​are valid.
Avoid the use of symbols with accidentals, trying to use only ASCII symbols. For example, the month of March must be written without "ç", that is, "marco". In this way, problems with encoding the texts are avoided.
