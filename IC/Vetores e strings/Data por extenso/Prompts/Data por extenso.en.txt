Exercise name: Data in full

Description:
Write a program in python that reads a date in the format "ddmmyyyy" as input and prints that date in words as output.

Format for data input and output:
The input format is "ddmmyyyy", where "dd" is the two-digit day of the month, "mm" is the two-digit month number of the year, and "yyyy" is the full year.
The output format is "day of month spelled out of year".

Always assume that input values ​​are valid.
Avoid the use of symbols with accidentals, trying to use only ASCII symbols. For example, the month of March must be written without "ç", that is, "marco". In this way, problems with encoding the texts are avoided.
