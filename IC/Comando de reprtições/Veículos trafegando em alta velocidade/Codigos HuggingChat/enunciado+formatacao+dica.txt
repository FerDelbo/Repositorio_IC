Here is one possible solution:

def count_speeding_drivers(speeds):
    max_speed = speeds[0]
    infractions = 0
    
    for i in range(1, len(speeds)):
        if speeds[i] > max_speed * 1.2:
            print("Driver {} exceeded the speed limit".format(i))
            infractions += 1
        
    return infractions
