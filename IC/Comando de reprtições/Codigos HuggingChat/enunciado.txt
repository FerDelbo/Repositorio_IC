Here is one possible solution:

import math

def calculate_speed(distance, time):
    return distance / time

def check_speed_limit(speed, max_allowed):
    if speed > (max_allowed * 1.5):
        print("Driver exceeded speed limit by more than 50%.")
    elif speed > (max_allowed * 1.2):
        print("Driver exceeded speed limit by more than 30%.")
    else:
        print("No speeding detected.")

# Example usage
dist = 100 # kilometers
time = 60 # minutes
speed = calculate_speed(dist, time)
check_speed_limit(speed, 80) # maximum speed allowed on this road is 80 km/h
